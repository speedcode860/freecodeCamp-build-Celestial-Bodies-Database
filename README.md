Universe Database – freeCodeCamp Project
This repository contains the universe.sql file, a PostgreSQL dump of the database built for the Build a Celestial Bodies Database project on freeCodeCamp.
The database models a fictional universe with several tables connected through foreign keys:
- galaxy: information about galaxies
- star: stars associated with galaxies
- planet: planets associated with stars
- moon: moons associated with planets
- more_informations: additional data linked to planets
The SQL file allows recreating the complete structure (tables, constraints, primary and foreign keys) along with sample data.
📌 Goal: pass all project tests on freeCodeCamp and share the solution publicly.
